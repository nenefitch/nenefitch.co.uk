		                                        Regulatory change has a number of characteristics that differentiate it from other transformation initiatives within your organisation.  For example, it may be necessary to respond to a piece of legislation that is not yet fully detailed or finalised.  Alternatively, a Section 166 may have been served but the material actions required to respond to it are not yet known.

		                                        Effective process design not only ensures that regulatory requirements are met but also provides confidence that the process will embed and continue to function in BAU.  Our skilled consultants are able to determine exactly what is necessary to meet the regulatory requirement, examine your existing ‘as is’ processes to see what needs to change and then build out and deploy your new ‘to be’ process.  We design processes to ensure maximum efficiency in terms of up-front build and operational cost and, where possible, are able to reduce duplication and increase efficiency in your existing ‘as is’ processes at the same time.

Nene Fitch have run large software programmes to develop bespoke toolsets including HR certification and compliant marketing tools.
